# Airbnb Data Analysis

## Overview
This project presents an exploratory data analysis of Airbnb listings using publicly available datasets. The analysis investigates neighborhood popularity, pricing patterns, availability trends, and user review activity through data preprocessing, visualization, and geospatial mapping techniques in Python.

## Datasets
The project uses the following datasets:
- **`listings.csv`** - Information about Airbnb listings (location, room type, price, etc.)
- **`calendar.csv`** - Daily availability and pricing per listing
- **`reviews.csv`** - User reviews with associated dates

## Objectives
The main objectives of this analysis are:
- To identify and rank neighborhoods based on the number of Airbnb listings
- To analyze pricing differences across neighborhoods and room types
- To examine availability and price trends over time
- To study temporal patterns in Airbnb review activity
- To visualize listings geographically using interactive maps

## Methodology
The analysis follows these steps:
1. Data loading and preprocessing
2. Exploratory data analysis of listings and neighborhoods
3. Price and room-type analysis
4. Time-series analysis of availability and reviews
5. Data visualization using plots and geospatial maps
